# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Alan Zaharia

## Overview.

The react project is an extension to the react movie lab works with only new endpoints, small changes in UI and new features. There is a total of four new static endpoints and two new parameterised endpoints added to the app. The new features and functionalities are a dropbox menu for the different links and a watchlist added to the app.

## Features.
+ Watchlist -  added playlist icon to all pages to add movies to the watchlist page

+ Dropbox Menu for links to pages


## Setup requirements.

The first part is to enter the directory of assignment, then to enter the movie folder and simply enter npm start to start development of the website locally

## API endpoints.

Static Endpoints
+ Popular - /movies/popular - displays popular movies
+ Top Rated - /movies/topRated - displays all time top rated movies
+ Now Playing - /movies/nowPlaying - displaying now playing movies

Parameterised Endpoints
+ Recommendations - /movies/recommendations - displays movies recommendations based on specific id (9479) which is The Nightmare Before Christmas
+ Similar - /movies/similar - displays similar movies to recommendations( it has the same ID).

## Routing.

I didnt know how to add routing.

## Independent learning (If relevant).


I mainly used the lab work to write the code for the assignment. I used Chatgpt to trouble shoot and help explain the function of some of the code. I used Chatgpt to help create the dropbox menu which it only stated to remove code. For the appbar I used this website to help understand it.
